    			What is Efico all about?
    		</h3>
    		<p id="ans" class="answers">We have discovered that undergraduates are not exposed to the realities of the "life after
school", some of them are confused and frustrated about the educational system and how well
to navigate it and acquire skills amidst the myriads of skills available. Hence, we help them find
their unique place in value creation and instill relevant skills that make their education make
sense and avail them to be truly successful upon graduation.</p>

    			How do I join this community?
    		</h3>
    		<p id="ans" class="answers">We are building an ecosystem of competent Eficos around all campuses in Nigeria. There is an
Efico hub in your school. You can join the online WhatsApp community group where you would
be directed to your rightful university community after the orientation.</p>

    		<h3 class="questions">When and where does training take place?</h3>
    		<p id="ans" class="answers">Since our mission is focused majorly on undergraduates and secondary school students and
helping them like a guardian angel till graduation, you might not be getting the training highly
subsidized just as they do. But you can always have access to all our resources.</p>
